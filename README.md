# Bluetooth-arduino-ultrasonic-I2C-display
## This was a group project for our linear-algebra course
We did this project a long time ago, but I didn't have github then =)

A simple pet-project, I2C display+Bluetooth Sonar
We try to find the distance of an object using an ultrasonic sensor connected to an Arduino board, and showing the results both on an I2C display and sending it through the serial communication protocol using an HC 06 bluetooth sensor.
You then can display read the distance on the I2C 16x2 lcd and using a bletooth terminal, you can view it your smartphone.

The project itself

and the reading on the lcd:

This project belongs to a long time ago and I just realized I did take any screenshots of the distance shown on the terminal, but trust me, it's there :) Also you can check the videos!
